# Build Bar UI mod

A simple little mod that adds a new GUI for crafting.

Simply set the recipe, click the orange build button and off you go! The main purpose of this is to allow you to craft chosen items without going into your inventory window. Especially helpful in the early game when you need to craft items manually.

Left click = build 1 item
Right click = build 5 items
Shift + Left click = build as many as possible

Drag the Build Bar freely by its title

Available settings:

- Build bar enable/disable
- Horizontal Build Bar layout on/off
- Show only recipes that you have enabled for you
- Adjust the number of build bar slots 1-10
